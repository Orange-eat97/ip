# CC User Guide

Imagine having a cute _wombat_ helping you track your tasks? CC bot got it.


CC bot supports these functions:

## todo t/TASK

Adds a _"todo"_ task to your tasklist. 

*Todo task has no deadline, no start, free and easy. 
*Once added successfully, CC tells you how many tasks you have right now, also the entry of the task, with its type and completion status. 

Example: 

```
todo run

```


## deadline t/TASK, by d/DATE

Adds a _"deadline"_ task to your tasklist. 

*Deadline task has a deadline, no start. 
*Various date formats are supported,such as DD-MM-YYYY, DD/MM/YYYY, but not alphabetical input, such as "12 Dec 2025". 
*Once added successfully, CC tells you how many tasks you have right now, also the entry of the task, with its type and completion status. 
*If invalid date format is provided, CC asks you "Where got time?"

Example: 

```
deadline more run, by 19/9/2025

```


## event t/TASK, from d/DATE, to d/DATE

*Event task has a deadline and a start. 
*Various date formats are supported,  such as DD-MM-YYYY, DD/MM/YYYY, but not alphabetical input, such as "12 Dec 2025".
*Once added successfully, CC tells you how many tasks you have right now, also the entry of the task, with its type and completion status. 
*If invalid date format is provided, CC asks you "Where got time?"

Example: 

```
evnet more more run, from 2-12-2025, to 3/12/2025

```

## list

"list" returns all the task in your tasklist at the moment. 

*Each task's type, and completion status is reflected. 
*If you have added a priority to the task, it is also reflected.

Example: 

```
:list
1. [T][X][P=1] run
2. [E][ ] more run(from Feb 02 2024 to Mar 03 2025)

```

## delete n/NUMBER

Deletes the task at serial number NUMBER in the tasklist.

Example: 

```
:list
1. [T][X][P=1] run
2. [E][ ] more run(from Feb 02 2024 to Mar 03 2025)

:delete 2
magic magic it's gone:
[E][ ] more run(from Feb 02 2024 to Mar 03 2025)
1 task left

```

## mark n/NUMBER & unmark n/NUMBER

Mark and unmark toggle the completion status of each task. 

*Tasks are identified by the serial number they are given in the tasklist.

Example: 

```
:mark 1
Nice! You got it boss:
[T][X] run

:unmark 1
Fine get it done soon:
[T][] run

```

## find w/WORD

Lists all tasks including this word. 

*Serial numbers are according to their numbers in the list, so you can use the serial number in unmark, mark directly.

Example: 
```
:list 
1. [T][X] run
2. [T][X] eat
3. [T][X] run

:find run
1. [T][X] run
3. [T][X] run	//index follows that in the list

```

## priority n/SERIAL_NUMBER p/PRIORITY

Adds a priority to your task. 

Example: 
```
:list 
1. [T][X] run

:priority 1 1
[T][][P=1] run

```

##Known issues
1. When the command is not handled but also does not create an exception, CC would return an empty line. If this happens, just input your next command.
